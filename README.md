# Data-engineering-case-studies
This repository documents structured technical investigations across SQL and ETL based data systems.

Each case study explains how an issue was identified,analyzed, and resolved using a systematic debugging approach.

# Structure

Every case study follows a consistent framework:

 1.Context
 
 2.Observed Behaviour
 
 3.Investigation Strategy
 
 4.Root Cause
 
 5.Resolution
 
 6.Preventive/Engineering Insight

The emphasis is on reasoning,validation, and technical clarity.

All scenarios are generalized representations of common system-level challenges.
